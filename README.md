# Resource Area Notifier
**Resource area notifier notifies the user when the gate in the wilderness Resource Area opens**, with a decent amount of customizability regarding notification overlay/sound.<br>

**This plugin adds the following features:**
- Add a RuneLite notification.
- Add customizable notification overlays such as box solid or box flash.
- Choose custom notification sounds.
- Ignore friends/FC members/CC members/other players.
- The custom notification overlay will be displayed and the audio notification will be played when you change the respective config settings. This allows the user to preview their settings. Keep in mind that you might have to temporarily disable 'Remove overlay on ignored player' when testing overlay config changes in the resource area, or the preview of the overlay will likely be removed immediately after the minimum duration set in the config.

## Additional info
Please note that this plugin does **not** provide the user with any information that would otherwise not be available to them!

If you experience any issues or have any concerns, please reach out to YvesW via a GitHub Issue, by Discord direct messaging or via the RuneLite Discord by mentioning @Yves W.

Thanks to [m0bilebtw](https://github.com/m0bilebtw) for the SoundEngine and SoundFileManager code! They've only been slightly adjusted.
